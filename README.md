1)Node.js Installation:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from nodejs.org.
2)Package Installation:

Create a new directory for your project.
Inside this directory, initialize a new Node.js project by running:

npm init -y

Install necessary packages (iohook and keycode) using npm:

npm install iohook keycode






****Creating a Test File:
Create a new file, let's say index.js, where you'll instantiate the Keyboard class and handle its events:

javascript

const Keyboard = require('./keyboard');

const keyboard = new Keyboard();

keyboard.on('keydown', (event) => {
  console.log('Key pressed:', event.key, '(', event.combinedKey, ')');
});

keyboard.on('keyup', (event) => {
  console.log('Key released:', event.key);
});

keyboard.start();

// Gracefully stop the keyboard listener on process exit
process.on('exit', () => {
  keyboard.stop();
});




Running the Application:
In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved keyboard.js and index.js, then run:

node index.js
